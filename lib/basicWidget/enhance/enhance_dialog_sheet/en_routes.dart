/// This function takes a `pageBuilder`, which typically builds a dialog.

/// The `barrierDismissible` argument is used to indicate whether tapping on the
/// barrier will dismiss the dialog. It is `true` by default and cannot be `null`.

/// The `barrierColor` argument is used to specify the color of the modal
/// barrier that darkens everything below the dialog. If `null`, the default

/// content of the route (typically a dialog widget). Content below the dialog
/// is dimmed with a [ModalBarrier]. The widget returned by the `pageBuilder`
/// does not share a context with the location that [showGeneralDialog] is
/// originally called from. Use a [StatefulBuilder] or a custom
/// [StatefulWidget] if the dialog needs to update dynamically. The
/// `pageBuilder` argument can not be null.
///
/// The `context` argument is used to look up the [Navigator] for the
/// dialog. It is only used when the method is called. Its corresponding widget
/// can be safely removed from the tree before the dialog is closed.
///
/// The `useRootNavigator` argument is used to determine whether to push the
/// dialog to the [Navigator] furthest from or nearest to the given `context`.
/// By default, `useRootNavigator` is `true` and the dialog route created by
/// this method is pushed to the root navigator.
///
/// If the application has multiple [Navigator] objects, it may be necessary to
/// call `Navigator.of(context, rootNavigator: true).pop(result)` to close the
/// dialog rather than just `Navigator.pop(context, result)`.
///
/// The `barrierDismissible` argument is used to determine whether this route
/// can be dismissed by tapping the modal barrier. This argument defaults
/// to false. If `barrierDismissible` is true, a non-null `barrierLabel` must be
/// provided.
///
/// The `barrierLabel` argument is the semantic label used for a dismissible
/// barrier. This argument defaults to `null`.
///
/// The `barrierColor` argument is the color used for the modal barrier. This
/// argument defaults to `Color(0x80000000)`.
///
/// The `transitionDuration` argument is used to determine how long it takes
/// for the route to arrive on or leave off the screen. This argument defaults
/// to 200 milliseconds.
///
/// The `transitionBuilder` argument is used to define how the route arrives on
/// and leaves off the screen. By default, the transition is a linear fade of
/// the page's contents.
///
/// The `routeSettings` will be used in the construction of the dialog's route.

///
/// Using this method will not enable state restoration for the dialog. In order
/// to enable state restoration for a dialog, use [Navigator.restorablePush]
/// or [Navigator.restorablePushNamed] with [RawDialogRoute].
///
/// For more information about state restoration, see [RestorationManager].
///
/// {@tool sample}
/// This sample demonstrates how to create a restorable dialog. This is
/// accomplished by enabling state restoration by specifying
/// [WidgetsApp.restorationScopeId] and using [Navigator.restorablePush] to
/// push [RawDialogRoute] when the button is tapped.
